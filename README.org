* dotemacs README

This is my personal Emacs configuration. It is both highly personalized and a
bit of a playground; likely broken at any given time, and running code from it
will delete data without warning. That being said, it can be useful to see
others' configurations, so here is mine.

All configuration is done in =emacs-lisp= code blocks in [[file:init.org::*init.org][init.org]]. When updating
my configuration, I make changes in the =org= file and then I evaluate the first
code block (=C-c C-c= or =M-x org-babel-src-execute=), which [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][extracts]] select
=emacs-lisp= code blocks into =~/.emacs.d/init.el=, *overwriting* the existing
config. Once the new =init.el= is created, it is evaluated to update the current
session's settings.

Again, the existing =~/.emacs.d/init.el= gets nuked without warning. Please do not
run this code block yourself unless you fully understand it.
